# 👋 Hello

I'm a high school student who loves building things with code. I've been programming for over 3 years and enjoy solving logical problems and automating tasks.

### 💻 Languages I Use
- **C#** – Object-oriented coding, queues, linked lists, modding (Mostly Unity)
- **Python** – Scripts, tools, simulations (Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo, cryptogram)
- **C++** – Logic-heavy programming and math-based models

### 🔧 Projects

- [1-priority-queue-csharp](./1priority-queue-csharp)  
  Custom priority queue using linked nodes in C# (no arrays or lists)

- [2-portfolio-simulator](./2portfolio-simulator)  
  Python simulator for option portfolio P/L

- [3-stock-comparison-tool](./3stock-comparison-tool)  
  Python script comparing volatility, returns, and prices of two stocks

- [4-black-scholes-cpp](./4black-scholes-cpp)  
  C++ Black-Scholes option pricer using user input

- [5-monte-carlo-options](./5monte-carlo-options)  
  C++ Monte Carlo simulation for European call options

- [6-password-strength-checker](./checkpassword)
  Python and C++ implementations of a password strength checker.
  Validates passwords against a weak password list, checks uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols, calculates entropy, and provides strength feedback.

### 🎯 Goals
- Keep improving in cybersecurity, automation, and math-heavy programming  
- Gain real-world experience through freelance, tutoring, or internships  
- Build a strong portfolio and work with great teams
