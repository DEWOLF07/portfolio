# 👋 Hello

I'm a high school student who loves building things with code. I've been programming for over 3 years and enjoy solving logical problems and automating tasks.

### 💻 Languages I Use
- **C#** – Object-oriented coding, queues, linked lists, modding (Mostly Unity)
- **Python** – Scripts, tools, simulations (Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo, cryptogram)
- **C++** – Logic-heavy programming and math-based models

### 🔧 Projects I've Worked On

- `priority-queue-csharp`  
  Custom priority queue using linked nodes in C# with no arrays or lists.

- `black-scholes-cpp`  
  Simple C++ program to price European options using the Black-Scholes formula.

- `monte-carlo-options`  
  Monte Carlo simulation in C++ estimating European call option prices.

- `stock-comparison-tool`  
  Python script that compares two stocks’ volatility, average returns, and plots their price.

- `portfolio-simulator`  
  Python program simulating option portfolio profit/loss across stock prices.

### 🎯 Goals
- Keep improving in cybersecurity, automation, and math-heavy programming  
- Gain real-world experience through freelance, tutoring, or internships  
- Build a strong portfolio and work with great teams
