# 👋 Hello

I'm a high school student who loves building things with code. I've been programming for over 3 years and enjoy solving logical problems and automating tasks.

### 💻 Languages I Use
- **C#** – Object-oriented coding, queues, linked lists, modding (Mostly Unity)
- **Python** – Scripts, tools, simulations (Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo,cryptogram)
- **C++** – Logic-heavy programming and math-based models

### 🔧 Projects I've Worked On
- `priority-queue-csharp`: Custom priority queue using object-oriented design, no arrays or lists
- `black-scholes-python`: A basic option pricing model with simulations
- `unity-mod-dryingrack`: A Unity mod that modifies item timing 

### 🎯 Goals
- Keep improving in cybersecurity, automation, and math-heavy programming
- Gain real-world experience through freelance, tutoring, or internships
- Build a strong portfolio and work with great teams
