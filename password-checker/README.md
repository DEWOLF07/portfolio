üîê Password Strength Checker (Python + C++)
Overview

This repository contains two separate implementations of a password strength checker:

* Python version ‚Äì concise, beginner-friendly, and easy to modify.

* C++ version ‚Äì more verbose, demonstrates low-level control and performance-focused design.

Both versions:

* Load a small list of common weak passwords and reject them instantly.

* Check for uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

- Calculate password entropy using:

  - Shannon entropy (based on character distribution)

  - Pool size entropy (based on possible character set size)

* Classify password strength from Very Weak ‚Üí Very Strong.

* Provide actionable advice for improving weak passwords.
