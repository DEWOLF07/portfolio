üîê Password Strength Checker (Python + C++)
Overview

This repository contains two separate implementations of a password strength checker:

Python version ‚Äì concise, beginner-friendly, and easy to modify.

C++ version ‚Äì more verbose, demonstrates low-level control and performance-oriented design.

Both versions:

Load a small list of common weak passwords and instantly reject them.

Check for uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

Calculate password entropy using:

Shannon entropy (character distribution)

Pool size entropy (based on possible character set size)

Classify password strength from Very Weak ‚Üí Very Strong.

Provide advice for improving weak passwords.
